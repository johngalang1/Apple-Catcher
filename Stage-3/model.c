/* 
NAME: generate_apple
PARAMETERS: UINT16 col
PURPOSE: to initialize an apple object to a specific column (x value) 
        and assign it to an index in the apple array.
DETAILS: keeps track of how many apples have been created and uses
        that tracker to assign each new apple to a unique index in 
        the apple array (no need for return). Each apple's inital y
        value is -32 which means it will not be on-screen immediately, 
        this is so that apples will "fall" onto the screen instead of 
        just appearing at y = 0. (col * 32) + 128 assigns the x value 
        to plot the apple into one of 12 columns in the play area (0 - 11). 
EXAMPLE CALL: generate_apple(n) where n represents an integer 0 - 11 for 
            desired column.
